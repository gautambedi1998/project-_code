##### OpenCV installation requirements:
1) Cooling system on RPi.
2) Free empty space on RPi.
3) Raspbian Stretch installed.
4) User ready to pause the installation using "CTRL + X" and bringing the installation back using "fg" command.
5) Keep checking the core temperature of the CPU using the "/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp" command.


##### Compile OpenCV using the guide given above with pausing it in middle and resuming the installation process to cool down the RPi.

##### When compiling the OpenCV using the "make -j4" command, if the installation is stuck for a very long time at 99% or 100% don't stop the compiling, instead pause it using "CTRL + X" and then put command as "make -j1" and wait for it to finish compiling.


##### In order to get into the python mode for OpenCV you have to first declare the source as the profile file using the command "source ~/.profile". Then you can use the "workon cv" command.


##### Running the face recognition whole project:
	If you want you can put pics of an individual inside the dataset folder with the name of the person as the folder name.

1) source ~/.profile
2) workon cv
3) cd Desktop/working_new/working_face_recognition/ 
      (In short just navigate to the folder containing the project.)
4) python extract_embeddings.py --dataset dataset --embeddings output/embeddings.pickle --detector face_detection_model --embedding-model openface_nn4.small2.v1.t7
	(Now the project should start processing the images.)
5) python train_model.py --embeddings output/embeddings.pickle --recognizer output/recognizer.pickle --le output/le.pickle
6) sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2
7) After this you can START FACE RECOGNITION IN PICS OR LIVE STREAM VIDEOS USING THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS.

 %%%% For face recognition %%%
	python recognize.py --detector face_detection_model \ --embedding-model openface_nn4.small2.v1.t7 \ --recognizer output/recognizer.pickle \ --le output/le.pickle \ --image images/adrian.jpg


 %%%% For video recognition %%%  
	python recognize_video.py --detector face_detection_model --embedding-model openface_nn4.small2.v1.t7 --recognizer output/recognizer.pickle --le output/le.pickle
